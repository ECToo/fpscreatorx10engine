## FPS Creator X10 Engine ##

You can use this code to recompile the FPS Creator X10 map editor and game engine, and modify the code to add your own features. You will need the free X10 modders kit available from www.fpscreatorx10.com downloaded and extracted before you can load and compile the source files.

This source code requires a special experimental version of Dark Basic Pro for DirectX 10 which can be found as part of the X10 modders kit.
